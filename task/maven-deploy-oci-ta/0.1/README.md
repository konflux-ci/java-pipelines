# maven-deploy-oci-ta task

Builds Maven project artifacts using the Maven `deploy` goal, then deploys a
component build artifact to a container registry as an OCI image manifest.

## What this task does / does not do

**Does:**

- Runs `mvn clean source:jar deploy` with a local staging repository at
  `target/stage-deploy` (`-DaltDeploymentRepository=local::file:./target/stage-deploy`).
  Maven's deploy machinery is used only as a build-time packaging step.
- Packages the staged Maven repository layout into a single OCI image layer.
- **Deploys (pushes)** that layout to the container registry as an OCI image
  manifest with `artifactType: application/vnd.konflux.maven.repository.v1+tar`.

**Does not:**

- Publish artifacts to a remote Maven repository (Nexus, Artifactory, GitHub
  Packages, etc.).
- Run dependency prefetching or hermetic/Cachi2 builds in v1.

Consumers pull the OCI artifact from the registry and extract the embedded
Maven-repository-layout layer when needed.
